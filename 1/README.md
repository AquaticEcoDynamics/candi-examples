# candi-examples

Open the VSC project named 'candi-examples_results'.

In VSC open the R folder.
Open the file 'SixPlotsCandi-Examples.R'

See if you can run the R script through VSC over the network drive. I found it ran fast.
If it goes wrong, it will probably be because of installing packages.

Six-panel plots should get updated.
